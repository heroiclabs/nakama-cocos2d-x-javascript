Nakama is an open-source distributed server for social and realtime games. For more information have a look at the [server documentation](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/).

If you encounter any issues with the server you can generate diagnostics for us with `nakama doctor`. Send these to support@heroiclabs.com or [open an issue](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama/issues). If you experience any issues with the client, it can be useful to enable trace (`this.client.createSocket(useSSL, true/*verboseLogging*/);`) to produce logs and [open an issue](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama-cocos2d-x-javascript/issues).
